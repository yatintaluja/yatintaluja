# 👋 I'm Yatin Taluja

**Founder @ Moksh Ved | Infrastructure & Security Architect**

I am an engineer with 11+ years of experience building, scaling, and securing high-stakes infrastructure. After a decade of leading platform engineering from the ground up, I am now focused on **Moksh Ved**—a venture dedicated to engineering integrity and "truth-telling" in technical architecture.

## 🎯 Current Focus: Moksh Ved
I am building a boutique engineering practice centred on technical honesty. I help organisations move past the hype to build systems that are actually resilient, secure, and architecturally sound.

* **Engineering Consulting:** Infrastructure audits, security hardening, and Kubernetes optimisation.
* **Philosophy:** Prioritising intellectual rigour and directness over corporate consensus.

## 🛠 Technical Expertise
* **Infrastructure:** Kubernetes (early adopter since 2015), AWS, Azure, GCP.
* **Security & Compliance:** Architected and achieved SOC2 Type 2 and HIPAA compliance; deep focus on DevSecOps and Zero Trust.
* **Scale:** Proven track record of managing 100+ Kubernetes clusters and scaling platforms from zero to global operations.

## 🚀 The Atlan Chapter (2014 – 2025)
As a **Founding Engineer** and later **Director of Engineering**, I was responsible for the platform's architectural evolution.
* Scaled the engineering team and infrastructure through every growth stage.
* Defined and implemented the **Seven Pillars of Platform Engineering**.
* Bridged the gap between high-level engineering leadership and deep, hands-on infrastructure security.

## 🌍 Philosophy & Values
* **Truth over Agreement:** I value intellectual sparring and challenging assumptions to find the most robust solution.
* **Minimalism:** "Keep it simple" isn't just a mantra; it's a requirement for secure and maintainable systems.
