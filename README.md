# 👋 Hello, World! I'm Yatin Taluja

🔧 I'm currently working as the Director of Engineering at [Atlan](https://atlan.com), where I help keep the gears of innovation turning. 

## 🌐 My Journey 

My career has been an exciting choose-your-own-adventure book. 📖 I've worn many hats, from crafting 📱 Android apps at the start of my tech journey, to taking up roles in Customer Support 🤝, Project Management 🗂️, and Engineering Leadership 🚀. I'm a proud orchestrator of tech solutions, problem-solver, listener, and resolver.

One highlight of my journey? I once built an app in a record-breaking 7 days! I felt like a caffeinated hacker in a movie montage. 💻⚡ 

## ☁️ My Work in the Cloud 

Cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and GCP have been trusty sidekicks in my journey. Kubernetes has been my loyal companion since 2015.

Stepping into the role of running Cloud at Atlan felt like a solo trek up a mountain. 🏔️ But the journey is never solo, is it? I've been able to build and nurture a team that ensures we reach the summit together.

Under my stewardship, we've achieved SOC2 Type 2 and HIPAA compliance and are now gearing up for GDPR and ISO27001. 🚀

## 🌱 My Philosophy 

When it comes to hiring, I've learned that it's a bit like gardening: plant the right seeds, tend to them, and watch them grow. 

I'm currently nurturing Atlan's seven pillars of Platform Engineering. My aim is to build a team that feels like a rock band - each member in perfect sync, creating a symphony of solutions for developers. 🎵

## 🌟 My Mantra 

Keep it simple, take action, and never stop learning. 

## 🌍 My Dream 

In my quieter moments, I ponder about sustainable development and how we can code a better future for our planet. 

## 👀 What's Next? 

I'm just another engineer trying to make a difference. I'm excited about connecting, sharing, and learning with the GitHub community! 🤝

Feel free to reach out to me if you want to collaborate, need guidance, or just want to chat about tech and sustainability! 😊
